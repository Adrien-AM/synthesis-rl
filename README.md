Program synthesis by RL

The goal of this project is to train an agent to generate programs solving the Lunar Lander problem (from Gym).
We tested multiple approaches, including writing PID Controllers and Decision Trees. Then, we wrote a Domain Specific Language to generate these components automatically.
